GUI render required data

--- 0 is used to disable the feature, the data is sent to the pixel shader from the vertex shader
--- The gui system is required to fill the correct data

///// Quad UI renderer

For blocks, fonts, icons, and atlased textures
All the blocks are going to be rendered with all the faces facing the same direction

// VERTEX BUFFER - INSTANCE

* Rect position and size //This should be stored as a vertex buffer per instance as it is required by all indexes
* Mask index
* Texture Position Index
* Border Radius index
* Color index
	- 0 use the color texture directly 
	//This should not happen if the texture position index is 0 (catch error on the CPU!)
* Texture sample color channel
	- 0 use color directly
	- 1 use R channel as quad mask
	- 2 use G channel as quad mask
	- 3 use B channel as quad mask
	- 4 use A channel as quad mask
	//Maybe extend it later to suport mutlicolored texture samples
* Type ( rect circle )

// BUFFER END

* Rect mask - STORAGE BUFFER
	float4 (x,y) position center (z,w) width height
	// A single object is only going to use a single one, the mask should be properly computed by the computed
	// A single rect mask can be reused by multiple elements

* Border Radius - STORAGE BUFFER
	float4 (x,y,z,w) top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right radius
	//This is measured in pixel units

* Texture position - STORAGE BUFFER
	float3 (x,y) uv position (z) the texture array selection
	// Considering this is only going to change if the data inside the textures change, then this buffer should be
	// created and not be change until there is a change in the textures array currently in use
	// A copy of the buffer with more information should be kept in the CPU for the other systems to be able to use it easily

* Color - STORAGE BUFFER
	-- t1
		float4 color
	-- t2
		float4 color 0
		float4 color 1
		float2 uv start
		float2 uv end
